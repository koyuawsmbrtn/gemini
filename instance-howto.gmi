# How to get listed on the instance recommendation list

* Your instance is older than six months (can’t be checked that easily, so I just take when the domain for the instance has been registered)
* You don’t block too many instances so that it makes it harder for your users to communicate
* Either you openly publish your blocklist or tell me who you blocked. Again, I want people to communicate.
* The admins are easily reachable and users can come to them whenever they have a problem and get on-point answers to their problems. A user forum would be nice, but not necessary.
* You are 100% sure your instance will live on for a long period of time
* Regular backups of user data or any other data safety measures
* GDPR compliant (e.g. no Google Analytics and allowing users to request or delete their data, hosting preferably EU-based)
* Transport layer security (TLS) so packets are safe and sound when being in transit (this doesn’t mean admins or law enforcement are not permitted to read your messages, if you want safe communication use an encrypted messaging service like Element)
* You guarantee a certain amount of uptime (ideally >90%)
* Your instance shouldn’t be too generalist that it’d look plain and boring (mastodon.social and mstdn.io you are sadly out of luck here)
* Your instance should have less than 50k users so they are spread out evenly (who’s gonna pay for all that bandwidth)
* Your instance should stand out from the mass (theme it, add mods..whatever you feel like)
* Data mining is a big no-no which also includes selling user data to Facebook. Stop it, it’s disgusting. This is why we are on the fediverse.
* Your instance can run any software (Pleroma, Misskey, Mastodon, …)
* Must have open registrations (invite-only or manual approval okay)
* Shouldn’t be a single user instance
