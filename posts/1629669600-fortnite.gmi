# Creative expression through Fortnite

Fortnite is my favourite game, I say that unironically. With their creative mode which has been a thing for a while now a lot of people can create custom maps where they can play with their friends or hang out on. You can even publish your map through a map code which you can pass along to people.

These are actually pretty nice reasons for people who aren't just into battle royale right now. Fortnite isn't just a battle-royale game anymore (it never was to begin with), but rather a way to hang out with your friends and have fun with them. I could even think about the creative mode getting used in the educational sector, because with creative maps you could also teach a lot of things. It kind of is its own type of media.

Fortnite really grew from a "game that a few kids play" to something useful yet fun. It's really like Animal Crossing a virtual place to hang out with friends. There are even
