# Getting the Corona Warn-App (and similar) to run on /e/OS

Some of you already heard that I use /e/OS as a daily driver now. /e/OS is an operating system for mobile phones (a few of them to be precise) made by the /e/ foundation. Unlike traditional mobile operating systems like Android or iOS the whole thing doesn&#8217;t track you. I think your phone should be your phone and not Google&#8217;s or Apple&#8217;s. Recently after seeing the video by Laura and Aral I immediately noticed that other than iOS my other option towards a privacy-friendly, but low-cost mobile device would be /e/OS.

## So how do I install my COVID-19 tracking app?

Here in Germany we have an app that&#8217;s called the Corona Warn-App, yours may be called differently, but the process is the same for every other app.

To get started you do these steps (assuming you got /e/OS installed):

```html
<ol start="0">
  <li>
    Unlock your phone
  </li>
  <li>
    Swipe to the App store and tap the icon
  </li>
  <li>
    Then you tap categories
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are in the categories view you now scroll down and tap System apps
  </li>
  <li>
    Afterwards you hit &#8220;Install&#8221; on the only app that&#8217;s there called &#8220;microG Exposure Notifications&#8221;
  </li>
  <li>
    Then go back and hit the search icon and search for your desired COVID-19 tracking app made by your government and hit install there
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to settings, system, microG and tap &#8220;Exposure Notifications&#8221; and enable it
  </li>
  <li>
    Launch your COVID-19 tracking app and set it up.
  </li>
</ol>
```

You are now helping you and others detecting COVID-19 in your area! ðŸŽ‰
