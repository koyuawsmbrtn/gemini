# How to compile butt on Solus
Posted on July 23, 2020 by koyu	

This is a small tutorial on how I got butt (broadcast using this tool) working on Solus.

=> https://danielnoethen.de/butt/ First download the source code from here

and extract it. Now navigate to that folder with your terminal and issue the following commands in that folder.

Install compiler and dependencies

```
sudo eopkg install -c system.devel

sudo eopkg install libogg-devel libvorbis-devel lame-devel libflac-devel portaudio-devel libsamplerate-devel  fdk-aac-devel fltk-devel  opus-devel  libx11-devel bdwgc-dbginfo libpng-devel fontconfig-devel libxfixes-devel libxext-devel libxft-devel
```

Compile butt

```
./configure --prefix=/usr
make -j4
sudo make install
```

Now run the command butt from your terminal ðŸŽ‰
