# Why the "1" as favicon?
Posted on January 17, 2021 by koyu	

In standard SQL fashion users are getting a number. This number is easier for computers and programmers to process as you don’t have to type out changable values like an e-mail adress. It just saves time hunting your software for bugs.

My number in the koyu.space database is “1”. This is also why the favicon is a 1.

This is pretty unspectecular for advanced computer users, but it’s just something I wanted to write down for all the people who don’t know it.
