## But this Box is nonfree and uses DRM

Yes, I know, but this is a dedicated machine I use only for exactly these tasks. I use free software where I can. My phone and my computer run mostly free software (driver or BIOS blobs are sadly a thing though).

## Xbox Series S

I have an Xbox Series S with my own little neat customizations added to it like a purple accent color (purple is one of my favourite colors).

## Game and app list

  * Apex
  * Knockout City
  * Fortnite
  * Rocket League

## Gamepass

  * I started using Gamepass since March 2021 for 1‚Ç¨ (first month, afterwards 12,99‚Ç¨/month) and it absolutely slaps
  * The included EA Play subscription in Gamepass came to PC and now I started playing Sims 4
  * Of course I will use Gamepass on my Xbox alongside Xbox Gold to play online games
  * Microsoft began dropping the Xbox Gold requirement for free-to-play multiplayer games

The Xbox PSU has a little Master Chief engraved into it. Neat detail! üëç
