# Xbox Portal

## But this Box is nonfree and uses DRM

Yes, I know, but this is a dedicated machine I use only for exactly these tasks. I use free software where I can. My phone and my computer run mostly free software (driver or BIOS blobs are sadly a thing though).

## Xbox Series S

I have an Xbox Series S with my own little neat customizations added to it like a purple accent color (purple is one of my favourite colors).

## Game and app list

* Fortnite
* Rocket League
* Minecraft
* Forza Horizon 4
* Minecraft Dungeons
* Hyper Scape
* Overwatch
* Netflix
* Spotify
* YouTube
* Twitch
* Unigram (Telegram client)

## Gamepass

* I started using Gamepass since March 2021 for 1€ (first month, afterwards 12,99€/month) and it absolutely slaps
* The included EA Play subscription in Gamepass came to PC and now I started playing Sims 4
* Of course I will use Gamepass on my Xbox alongside Xbox Gold to play online games
* Microsoft dropped the Xbox Gold requirement for free-to-play multiplayer games
